# AI Task Manager - A Claude-flow Showcase Project

> **Project Goal**: Demonstrate how someone with minimal coding knowledge can build a full-stack application using Claude-flow and AI agent orchestration.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

This is a **learning journey documentation** showing how Claude-flow enables non-technical users to:
- Build a modern web application
- Coordinate multiple AI agents
- Follow best practices automatically
- Create production-ready code

## 📱 What We're Building

A modern Task Management application with:
- Beautiful, responsive UI
- User authentication
- Real-time updates
- Task categorization and prioritization
- Due date tracking
- Search and filtering

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Chosen by AI Agents)

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express
- **Database**: SQLite (easy to set up)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens

## 🚀 The Claude-flow Journey

This project documents the entire process of building an app using natural language commands:

### Phase 1: Project Setup
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha init --force
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "create project structure for a task management app"
```

### Phase 2: Backend Development
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "build REST API with authentication and CRUD operations for tasks"
```

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "create modern React UI with Tailwind for task management"
```

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "integrate frontend and backend, add error handling and tests"
```
