## 💡 How This Works

### Traditional Coding
```
1. Learn syntax
2. Read documentation  
3. Write boilerplate
4. Debug errors
5. Search Stack Overflow
6. Repeat...
```

### With Claude Code
```
1. Describe what you want
2. Claude generates code
3. Test it
4. Refine if needed
5. Done!
```

## 💪 What Makes This Powerful

### 1. Natural Language Control
```
"Add password reset functionality via email"
```
Claude implements it across the entire stack.

### 2. Context Awareness  
```
"Update the Task model we created earlier to include categories"
```
Claude remembers everything you've built.

### 3. Multi-File Coordination
```
"Add rich text editing for task descriptions"
```
Claude updates backend models, API endpoints, and frontend components together.

### 4. Iterative Refinement
```
"The login form should disable the button while submitting and show inline validation errors"
```
Easy to refine until perfect.

### 5. Learning & Explanation
```
"Explain how the JWT authentication flow works in this app"
```
Understand what you're building.

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Being Too Vague
**Bad:** "Make it better"  
**Good:** "Add smooth animations, better spacing, and a modern gradient background"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Skipping Testing
**Bad:** Build everything, then test  
**Good:** Test after each phase

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Documenting
**Bad:** Rush through without notes  
**Good:** Use journey-template.md to track progress

### ❌ Mistake 4: Not Asking Questions
**Bad:** Accept code you don't understand  
**Good:** "Explain how this authentication works"

### ❌ Mistake 5: Trying to Do Too Much
**Bad:** Add 10 features at once  
**Good:** Build incrementally, test each feature
