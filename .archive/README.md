## tutorial-docs/

Tutorial documentation files that were used for learning how to build with Claude Code. These files are preserved for historical reference but are not part of the active documentation structure.

**Archived files:**
- 00-START-HERE-CLAUDE.md - Original tutorial entry point
- MASTER-INDEX-CLAUDE.md - Navigation hub for tutorials
- CLAUDE-CODE-COMMANDS.md - Prompt patterns and examples
- CLAUDE-CODE-QUICKSTART.md - Step-by-step tutorial
- LESSONS-LEARNED-CLAUDE.md - Tips and best practices
- project-structure.md - Folder organization guide
- PACKAGE-CONTENTS.md - Complete package contents
- journey-template.md - Daily progress log template

**Current documentation structure:**
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Project-level context
- `/backend/CLAUDE.md` - Backend-specific context
- `/frontend/CLAUDE.md` - Frontend-specific context

These three files provide the recursive CLAUDE.md structure that is more efficient for day-to-day development work.
